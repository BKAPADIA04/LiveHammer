-> io = io is the main Socket.IO server instance. It represents the server-side socket and is used to manage communication at a global level, such as:
Broadcasting events to all clients or clients in a specific room.
Listening for client connections.
Managing rooms and namespaces.

-> socket = socket represents the individual connection between the server and a specific client. Each client gets its own socket instance when it connects to the server.
