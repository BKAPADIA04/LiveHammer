Step 1: Authentication
-> Database = MongoDB Atlas

Step 2: Video Conferencing
-> Frontend = WebRTC (https://youtu.be/WmR9IMUD_CY?si=Cxv2oo0W1WhUEgLh)
-> Backend = Socket.io (Set up signalling server)

Multiple user video conferencing (Mesh Network)
Use an SFU like Jitsi, Janus, or Mediasoup.
Clients send their streams to the server, which forwards optimized streams to other participants.

Step 3: Chatting among clients

Step 4: Product Description shown to all clients
-> Shared Dashboard that displays: Product Details, Current Bid, Auction Timer, Action Buttons(Place Bid)
-> Real time changes on new bids
-> Sound Alert
-> Redis for real time updates

-> Socket.io or Websockets

Step 5: Payment Gateway Integration
Flow of Payment Integration in the Auction System
The key steps for integrating a payment gateway upon a successful bid are:

-> User Wins the Auction: Once a client has the highest bid at the end of the auction or when they place a winning bid (after the auction timer runs out), the system should recognize them as the winner.
-> Payment Trigger: The system will trigger a request to the payment gateway for processing payment for the winning amount.
-> Redirect to Payment Gateway: The winner is redirected to the payment gateway page (or a payment modal) to complete the payment.
-> Payment Confirmation: After the user makes the payment, the payment gateway sends a response (success/failure) back to the system.
-> Order Confirmation & Invoice: Once payment is confirmed, the auction platform marks the transaction as successful and generates an invoice/receipt for the customer.
-> Notification: Notify both the bidder and auctioneer about the successful payment and proceed with product delivery or service fulfillment.

Step 6: Logs
-> Display Purse Remaining for each user
-> Display Products bought for each user
-> Display Plots based on Logs

Step 7: Auction Social Features
Share Auctions on Social Media: Allow users to share the auctions they are bidding on via social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).

Step 8: Multi-Currency and Multi-Language Support

Step 9: Deployment (Docker and Kubernetes)
