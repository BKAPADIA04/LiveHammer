Object Recognition
-> YOLO
-> Faster R-CNN

Features
-> Picking up Object
-> Zooming into Objects
-> Object Interaction

Chatbot
-> Rasa / Dialogflow

Prompts
-> "Pick an object," "Show an object," "Find object location"
-> Multiple Object Detection
-> Interaction with objects : drag" objects around the image, rotate them, or resize them 
("Move the bottle to the left" or "Rotate the apple" )
-> Object Counting
-> Background Removal and Segmentation ( "Remove the background of the apple" can use segmentation models like Mask R-CNN to extract the apple from the background.
)
-> Voice Command Integration (speech-to-text technology (e.g., Google Speech API, Whisper).)
-> "Find all red objects"
-> Users can upload a set of images with a specific object they want the system to detect (e.g., "Detect my favorite product").
-> OCR (Optical Character Recognition) "Read the text on the bottle" could extract and return the text present on the bottle in the image.


Advanced
-> Real-Time Object Detection
("Show the bottle" could immediately highlight the bottle in a live video stream or webcam feed.
)
-> User: "Remove the apple, then replace it with a banana."
-> Object Movement Tracking
Track the movement of objects across video frames or a series of images. This would require adding an object tracking algorithm (like SORT or Deep SORT).
Example: "Where is the apple moving?" could return the path the apple took in the video.
